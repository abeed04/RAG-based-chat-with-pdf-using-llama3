 This project implements a chat interface that allows users to ask questions about uploaded PDF documents. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining:

- Information Retrieval: Efficiently searching relevant passages in the PDF content using FAISS and text embeddings.
- Generative Language Model (LLM): Answering user questions in a comprehensive and informative way using Llama3, a large language model from Google AI for embeddings.

- Upload multiple PDF documents.
- Ask questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs.
- Get answers generated by Llama3 based on the retrieved information.
